# Neuro Navigator
Neuro Navigator is an AI-powered multi-agent assistant capable of performing research, planning, execution, and specialized domain tasks such as finance analysis, booking management, weather information retrieval, and web search. It is designed for modularity, making it easy to extend with new tools and agents.

Features
Multi-Agent Architecture
Includes specialized agents for:

Research

Planning

Execution

Finance

Custom domain-specific tasks

Integrated Tools

Search Tool – Retrieve and summarize online information

Weather Tool – Fetch real-time and forecast weather data

Booking Tool – Manage reservations or appointments

Vector Store – Store and retrieve contextually relevant memory for agents

Modular Design
Tools and agents are independent and can be easily replaced or upgraded.

Environment-Based Configuration
All sensitive information (API keys, credentials) is loaded from .env for security.

Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.10+

pip (Python package installer)

Git

Steps
Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Neuro_Navigator.git
cd Neuro_Navigator

Create a Virtual Environment (recommended)

bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows

Install Dependencies

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

You can copy the template provided in this README:

bash
cp .env.example .env

Then fill in the required values.

.env.example
# OpenAI API key for LLM-based agents
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Optional: Hugging Face API key if using hosted embeddings/models
HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN=your_huggingface_api_token_here

# Weather API key for real-time weather data
WEATHER_API_KEY=your_weather_api_key_here

# Booking API key if you integrate a booking/reservation tool
BOOKING_API_KEY=your_booking_api_key_here

# Environment setting (development or production)
ENV=development

# OpenAI API key for LLM-based agents
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Optional: Hugging Face API key if using hosted embeddings/models
HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN=your_huggingface_api_token_here

# Weather API key for real-time weather data
WEATHER_API_KEY=your_weather_api_key_here

# Booking API key if you integrate a booking/reservation tool
BOOKING_API_KEY=your_booking_api_key_here

# Environment setting (development or production)
ENV=development
Note: Never commit the real .env file — only commit .env.example.

Usage
Run the application:


python app.py

Or with Streamlit frontend:


streamlit run app.py
You can also execute specific modules for testing:


python agents/researcher.py
python tools/weather_tool.py
